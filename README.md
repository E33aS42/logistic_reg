# logistic_reg
An exercise to mathematically implement a logistic regression model and explore methods to decrease computational time (bonus).

# Introduction
Based on a dataset of the notes obtained by the students of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, I built a logistic regression that could classify to which of the 4 houses each student belongs to in function of their notes.

This project was done in 3 parts:
1. A data analysis helped identify which features to keep among the set of 20 different features.
2. A logitistic regression model was trained on our training set and could reach an accuracy above 98% on a provided test set .
3. Implementation of other optimization algorithms (stochastic gradient descent, minibatch GD, loss momentum, SGD+loss momentum) and comparison of the gain in computational time.
